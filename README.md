# Image-classifiers-and-convolutional-neural-networks

Project Overview
This project showcases the development and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of CNNs in identifying and classifying objects within images, using the Oxford-III Pet Dataset.

Features:
Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using tensorflow, keras-tuner, mobilenetV2 (building our own neural network in the later stages)
Data preprocessing techniques for image data.
Techniques for model evaluation and validation.
